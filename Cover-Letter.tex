Dear  Prof. ABC, \\
%\vspace*{1in}
I am interested in pursuing the ``POST-DOC POSITION OFFER IN THE `so and so' field" advertised recently in `website/information center' as it overlaps with my research interests and experience'.  My primary research goals are directed towards understanding physical phenomena using the simulation tools and techniques.  At present, I am working at the Center for Energy Research department at UCSD in the area of laser-target interaction. 
%My current project involves the Development of short pulse laser based neutron source for the Resonance Absorption Spectroscopy.
As a postdoct at UCSD, I have  done numerical and analytic studies on 'so and so topic name' and  gained expertise in hybrid 'so and so techiniques of' Simulation. \\
Prior to that during my graduate studies at 'so and so place', I was responsible for performing a number of significant numerical 
experiments and co-developed 'so and so codes'  Fortran/C++/Python codes(using package ABC). I have written scripts in MATLAB in parallel 
environment to solve a variety partial differential equations, Eigen value problems,  and 3D plotting.
The collective result of these and many other efforts, large and small, resulted in a development in the understanding of plasma physics phenomena of fundamental interest. \\
%fundamnetalrelativistic flow-shear driven instabilities.  \\
%To ascertain the verity of the numerical results, I carried out analytic work.  \\
I am articulate in writing and speech, and my interpersonal skill and scientific caliber has led me to continue my work 
%in an experimental group 
for six months beyond my one year postdoctoral contract at `so and so University'. 
%Oral and poster presentations at conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals speak of my capability as an independent researcher.
  I am extremely interested in working on the prescribe project as it involves strong and contemporary research,
   and excellent faculty and commitment to promote science driven global understanding. 
  %It would be a great opportunity for me to work with committed researchers on this international collaborative project.
%I have worked on analytic and computational means that solve Maxwell's equation coupled with equation of motion nonlinearly.
Besides my scientific skills, you will find in me an industrious and dedicated individual  performing his/her work  enthusiastically. 
%in an interdisciplinary and collaborative environment. 
 I would appreciate the opportunity to talk to you more about the prospect of the above mentioned position. \\

 Thank you for your review and consideration, \\
